        -PostgreSQL is the leading database candidate at this time (Looking for place to store audio)
    9/28/20 - 9/29/20
        -Setup virtual environment and made Python bootable from USB
        -Got Python 3.6 working on school PC
        -Looked into making scanningTones.py run in background using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59125493/how-to-constantly-run-python-script-in-the-background-on-windows
    10/5/20
        -Made speechRecord.py obsolete with scanningTones.py, will be deleted from version starting today forward, kept in older versions for reference
        -Made scanningTones.py to listen, record, then listen again
        -Reference for creating scanningTones.py - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18406570/python-record-audio-on-detected-sound
        -Added convertSpeech method to scanningTones.py, waiting to test
        -Worked with making a numpy array save to a text file
    10-13-20
        -Decided that a Numpy/Pandas array will be used instead of a database fr the foreseeable future
        -Haven't tested scanningTones.py with convertSpeech incorporated yet, if success, speechTest.py and speechManipulation.py will be obsolete
        -Experimented with CSV files and saving an array to them
        -Experimented with using openpyxl package to save output to spreadsheet instead of database
    10-19-20 - 10/20/20
        -Tested scanningTones.py, works instead of speechManipulation.py, speechRecord.py, and speechTest.py
        -Make scanningTones.py record for less time after silence in audio
        -Corrected a bug where time and date was not properly formatting on callOutput.txt
        -Want to track date/time, Text, Ref to audio
        -speechRecord.py, speechManipulation.py, & speechTest.py are all obsolete; Will be deleted form this and all future versions, will remain in formers
        -Made the folder OutputAudio for saving call audio to
        -In the Recorder.write() function, added path to OutputAudio folder
        -Decided against a spreadsheet for the time being
        -Using a Numpy array saved to a CSV file
        -Look at numTest.py and numpTestREAD.py for examples on how to read/write to CSV using Pandas and Numpy
        -Links to used resources: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3518778/how-do-i-read-csv-data-into-a-record-array-in-numpy  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31247198/python-pandas-write-content-of-dataframe-into-text-file
    10/27/20
        -Presented progress to class
        -Found error in saving to OutputAudio folder, circumvented and will fix later
        -#TODO Fix saving to OutputAudio
        -Learned how to remove a column from a csv file when bringing it into Python using Pandas
        -Decided to try using the CSV package to edit the CSV output file
        -Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects
    11/3/20
        -Made writecsv function in csvOutput.py to convert current output into a csv file
        -Changed location fo date and time objects and variables in scanningTones.py to increase accuracy, waiting to test
    11/10/20
        -Looked into file saving and directories for the audio outputs
        -Working on making save to a separate folder
        -Determined that it is unrealistic and unfeasible to have files save into a directory that is not the project directory, may reassess further down the line
        -Cleaned up workspace
        -Removed csvTest.py, numpTest.csv
    11/24/20
        -Removed numTest.py, numpTestREAD.py
        -Added writecsv function to scanningTones.py, making csvOutput.py obsolete
        -Removed scanningTones.py
        -Tested new accuracy of date/time (Time works down to the second of END OF RECORDING)
        -Cleared callOutput.csv and audio files from test
        -Created outputTest.py to test input through speaker
        -Further explored potential of recording using Broadcastify, not feasible on Windows, will attempt on a Linux distro
    12/8/20
        -Removed callOutput.txt
        -Tested multiple GUI formats
    12/15/20
